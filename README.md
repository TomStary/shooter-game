# MI-ADP Python template

This template is a *starting point* for all of those who wants to implement their 
semestral work from the MI-ADP course in Python programming language. 

It is deliberately dumb and incorrectly structured - it is your goal to make it 
beautiful and follow all the best coding practices and design/architecural 
patterns you'll learn throughout the semester.

## How to run

1. Make sure you have Python3 installed: `python3 --version`
2. Clone the repository: `git clone git@gitlab.fit.cvut.cz:drahoja9/mi-adp-python-template.git your_project_name`
3. Go to the root of the app: `cd your_project_name`
4. Create virtual environment: `python3 -m venv your_venv_dir`
5. Activate it: `source your_venv_dir/bin/activate`
6. Install all requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. Run the app: `python3 run.py`
